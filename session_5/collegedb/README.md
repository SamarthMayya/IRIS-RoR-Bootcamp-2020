# Database Schema 

I have added migrations, and migrated four tables, namely Student, Course, Registration and Assignment. For Student and Course I have assumed to have a many-to-many relationship, since every student can register for many courses, and every course can have many student, and hence, I added another table Registrations, with two attributes course_id and student_id, which are foreign keys referencing Course and Student table respectively. I have done this using the associations `belongs_to :student`, and `belongs_to :course` in the Registration model. In Student model, I have added an association `has_many :courses, through: :registrations`, that allows me to directly access the courses taken by the student, as `@student.courses`. In the Course model, I have added the association `has_many :students, through: :registrations`, that allows me to access all the students that have taken a particular course, as `@course.students`.
In the Assignment model, since every assignment must be a part of a course, I have added the `belongs_to :course` association in the model, and in the Course model, I have added the association `has_many :assignments`, since every course can have one or more assignments.  Now, if I want to access the assignments of a particular student `@student`, all I need to do is `@student.courses.find_by(course_id: <course id>).assignments`.
